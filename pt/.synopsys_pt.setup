# Synopsys strongly recommends that you uncomment the following command
# in order to set sh_command_abbrev_mode to the value "Command-Line-Only".
# Command abbreviation is intended as an interactive convenience.  Using
# abbreviations in scripts can cause commands to fail in subsequent releases.

# Some useful aliases
#
alias list_commands		help
alias report_constraints	report_constraint
alias report_clocks		report_clock

#
# The alias for get_clock was added when get_clock_network_objects
# was introduced, as it conflicts with get_clocks (and get_clock is a
# typical abbreviation for get_clocks)
#
alias get_clock get_clocks


#
#
# The alias of q to quit is commented out.  Remove the comment 
# character if you want this alias.  Some users find that having 
# this particular alias causes problems when mixed with page-mode
# for reports - an accidental repeated 'q' not only cancels the
# output but exits the tool.
#
#alias q quit
